# Placement Hub

Placement Hub is a comprehensive and distraction-free web platform built to help students prepare for placements in an organized and effective manner. It combines five key areas of placement preparation—DSA, Aptitude, Interview Questions, Resume Tips, and Curated Resources—into one unified platform.

Unlike traditional preparation platforms that require logins, premium access, or scattered resources, Placement Hub provides instant access to handpicked, real-world questions and solutions without clutter or barriers.

## Tech Stack Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Database: SQLite
- Deployment: GitHub Pages (Frontend), Render(Backend)

## Key Features

- No-login, hassle-free access to all content
- 100+ real DSA questions with both Python and Java solutions
- Curated and difficulty-sorted content across all categories
- Accordion-style UI for clean, expandable Q&A layout
- Admin dashboard to dynamically add and update questions
- Dark theme with minimalistic, user-friendly interface
- Combines all major placement prep topics in one place

## Why It's Unique

Most platforms only cover one or two aspects of placement prep, often requiring logins, subscriptions, or jumping between different tools. Placement Hub is different because:

- It merges all core placement topics into one centralized platform
- It is completely open-access with no login required
- It provides a smooth, focused experience for quick revisions or deep preparation
- It is designed to be lightweight and accessible on any device
